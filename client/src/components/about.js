    <h2> Concert Review </h2>
    <p>This is an open website where anyone can contribute a review to a live music concert they attended.  Something to keep in mind when writing your review is:</p>

    <p>Try not to compare the performance with the previous ones. It’s very easy to write that this performance is like the last one. Write about the music, write about the lyrics. Give a chance to new watchers to learn about the new performance, as something direct, and not through the prism of your brain. We’ve read a lot of reviews that almost entirely consist of comparisons. The exception to this rule is if the performance is frankly a weak presentation of old hits. Although this is also very subjective, as many conservative people refuse to accept something new and prefer old hits and performances. It’s just not right to compare the “quality” of the new performance, which you watched once or twice, with an old one you watched 200 times since the age of 14.</p>
